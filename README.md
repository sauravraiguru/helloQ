# Hello IBM-Q

1. Bell Test - Quantum example of Bell superposition, to defeat classical computers.
2. Ring Test - superposition & entaglement of a key / ring


I have used X,Y,Z gates for 3 (experimental units) dimensional position.
H (Hadamard) gates for superpositioning. Followed by Measure (M) gate to compute over Z
